# Module03
This project that includes Module 03 and 04 demonstrate basic usage of C# lists and dictionaries to manage a shopping cart and a product price catalog.

## Features

- Add items to a shopping cart and display its contents.
- Add or update product prices in a catalog using a dictionary.
- Display all product prices.

# Module05
# OOP Shapes Example

This project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C# using abstract classes and inheritance. It defines a `Shape` base class and two derived classes: `Circle` and `Square`. The program calculates and displays the area and color of each shape.

## Features

- Abstract base class `Shape` with an abstract `Area` property
- Derived classes: `Circle` and `Square`
- Demonstrates inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism
- Simple console output of shape details

## Getting Started
# Capstone Project  (Simple Sale App)

This project is a simple console application that demonstrates key concepts from various programming modules, culminating in a capstone project. The application connects to a SQL Server database to perform essential data operations, showcasing a full-stack approach in a lightweight console environment.

Features
Database Integration: Connects to a SQL Server database using a connection string.

Data Models: Utilizes classes to represent database entities, such as Product and Sale.

Repository Pattern: Implements a repository layer (ProductRepository, SaleRepository) to separate business logic from data access logic, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Simple Console Interface: Provides a command-line menu for user interaction to perform tasks such as adding, viewing, and updating data.

Benefit from Previous Modules: Builds upon foundational knowledge in C# programming, object-oriented principles, and database management.
